# Open Communities Launch Worksheet

## Overview

For open communities to feel successful, they must feel seen, safe, productive and valued. 
For product teams to grow through community engagement, they must design with success of both their product goals, and communities in mind. It can be tricky at times, but these steps can help you stay focused on the process, which has no beginning and no end - but rather periods of refocus.  Similarly organizations must plan for their employees success working in the open - recognizing efforts as aligned with business goals and rewarding success accordingly.

## Area of work: Community & Partnerships

The word 'community' can mean many things. User communities, activist communities, developer and support to name only a few. Reflecting on your product/initiative goals, now is the time to think deeply about your current and potential collaborators. What do you need? What do your contributors want to do?

2. Who is already collaborating with your organization, or has expressed interest?
3. Where are they (physically, and globally?)
4. What challenges, fears or limitations might they have (time, bandwidth, language, political etc)
5. How might we design contribution to accommodate those limitations?
6. How will these contributors **know** they are successful? What recognition formats are most valued by tenure and region?
7. What metrics will you use to track contributor success?  
8. Do you have mechanisms or budget for recognition, reward or costs-incurred?

## Area of work: Marketing & Communications

The role of communication and alignment between communities and brand marketing is crucial. There really is no 'community communications' there is only what your organization says publicly, and what is left to imagination. Fear uncertainty and doubt (FUD) will always emerge where people are left to fill in the gaps of their understanding.

### Strategic Alignment

1. What are the primary, secondary and community-owned channels for this organization? 'Primary' is where all communication should roll up.
2. Where are the folks you want to collaborate with already listening? Where do you need to be?
3. What metrics for communication are you tracking for a given project or community engagement?
4. How will you ensure consistent messaging across all teams engaging with community?
5. What is your plan for crisis communication or when things don't go as expected?
6. How will you amplify community successes and insights back to internal teams?

# Pulling it all together (example formats)

## Community Tasks (i.e. GitHub)
Issues are something that users, and contributors may already do. Defining project priorities through tagging ('project-priority') for example can help people zoom into help where they are most needed.

It's important with issues to be clear if someone is already working on an issue. A common complaint in communities is that visibility isn't always clear, and they waste time.

## Community Campaigns
Campaigns are time-bound initiatives, that map very well to code releases, and other efforts that have a clear launch-date. An end-date helps avoid any trailing efforts that may not be aligned with the original intent, and help people reconnect to new priorities.

**Campaign Components:**
1. Project name and goals as they relate to the business and/or mission
2. Contribution needed
3. Start date/end date
4. Steps to participate
5. Success criteria and how it will be measured
6. Communication plan

Each cycle should include a retrospective phase to capture insights and assess safety and inclusion outcomes before beginning the next iteration. **such debt, like technical debt, compounds if not addressed - make it a priority in every cycle.**
