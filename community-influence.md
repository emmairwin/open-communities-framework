# Community-First Product Strategy 

> A playbook for communities to shape the products they depend on

In the past I have leaned heavily into the product-team focus of building community, for resources like this one: 
[How to make open collaboration a strategic advantage](https://sunnydeveloper.com/open-source-collaboration-strategy-with-ai-prompts/).

It makes sense—as someone who helped product teams for over a decade think about, 
and build open communities -  to describe in renewable terms the steps needed to create mutual success on product goals.

**There is a GIANT big assumption here that the product is deserving of community attention though.  That the direction towards (whatever end goal) matches what people care about and want to see.**

That's why I created this inverted strategy for communities.

## The Core Community Problem

Products are built by teams with bosses, in companies with quarterly targets, 
using metrics that often don't measure what matters to *you* the person in <country> who speaks a specific language, 
has specific accessibility needs, lives under specific regulations, and wants to accomplish things the product team might minimize as a goal or leave out entirely.

---

## The Community Influence Cycle

This is a continual, renewable cycle—just like the product team's cycle, but that contributors and communities can use to influence product teams.

## Step 1: What problem are we trying to solve?


DRAFT

**The question product teams ask:** "What problem are we trying to solve through open collaboration?"  
**The flipped version for communities:** "What do we actually need this product to do for us; on things we care/worry about and aspire to see?"

### Jobs To Be Done 

Product teams think about jobs-to-be-done in terms of features. You should think about them in terms of **outcomes for your life, your region, your language, your context**.

**Prompt for reflection:**

> "I'm part of a community that relies on [product/project]. Here's what we actually need:
>
> - **Functional need:** What task do we need to accomplish? (e.g., "We need to translate our municipal documents")
> - **Contextual need:** What's specific to our situation? (e.g., "We're in a region with limited bandwidth," "We need right-to-left language support," "We have regulatory requirements")
> - **Values need:** What matters to us beyond functionality? (e.g., "Data sovereignty," "Local economic benefit," "Accessibility")
> - **Gaps:** Where does the current product fail us specifically?"

### Types of Community Goals

| Goal Type | Product Team Equivalent | Community Version |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Adoption | "Grow user base" | "Make this work for people like us" |
| Features | "Ship roadmap items" | "Enable what we actually do" |
| Sustainability | "Reduce churn" | "Keep this reliable for our long-term needs" |
| Influence | "Thought leadership" | "Ensure our voice shapes direction" |

### Red Flags That You're Not Ready

- You haven't articulated what "success" looks like for your community
- You expect the product team to guess what you need
- You're reacting to features rather than shaping them
- You don't know who else in your community shares these goals

---

## Step 2: Map the Landscape

**The question product teams ask:** "Who do we need to collaborate with?"  
**The question you ask:** "Where are the leverage points, and who else is pulling?"

### Map the Power Structure

Every product has a hierarchy of influence. Understand it:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ DECISION MAKERS                                │
│ (Who actually decides what gets built?)        │
│ - Core maintainers / product managers          │
│ - Funding sources / employers of maintainers   │
│ - Foundation governance (if applicable)        │
└───────────────────────┬────────────────────────┘
                        │
┌───────────────────────▼────────────────────────┐
│ INFLUENCE CHANNELS                             │
│ (How do decisions get made?)                   │
│ - Roadmap processes / RFCs                     │
│ - Governance meetings                          │
│ - Employer priorities of key contributors      │
│ - Foundation membership tiers                  │
│ - Major user/customer requests                 │
└───────────────────────┬────────────────────────┘
                        │
┌───────────────────────▼────────────────────────┐
│ CONTRIBUTION PATHS                             │
│ (How do you get heard?)                        │
│ - Issues / discussions                         │
│ - Pull requests                                │
│ - Community calls                              │
│ - Conferences / working groups                 │
│ - Direct relationships with maintainers        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Find Your Coalition

You're stronger together. Map:

- **Similar communities:** Who else needs what you need? (Other regions, languages, use cases)
- **Complementary communities:** Who has different needs but aligned interests?
- **Resourced allies:** Who has time/money/expertise you lack?
- **Institutional allies:** Universities, governments, NGOs, foundations with aligned missions

**Prompt for reflection:**

> "For the changes we need, who else would benefit? Who's already working on this? Who has resources we don't? What would a coalition look like?"

---

## Step 3: Build Leverage Points

**The question product teams ask:** "How do we engage contributors?"  
**The question you ask:** "How do we become impossible to ignore?"

### The Leverage Ladder

From lowest to highest influence:

1. **Users who complain** → Easy to dismiss
2. **Users who document problems well** → Harder to dismiss
3. **Users who propose solutions** → Now you're helping
4. **Contributors who submit patches** → Now you're invaluable
5. **Contributors who maintain critical areas** → Now you have real power
6. **Communities who represent significant usage** → Now you're a stakeholder
7. **Communities who could fork/leave** → Nuclear option, but real

### Building Leverage (Practical)

| Action | Leverage Gained |
|--------|-----------------|
| File detailed, reproducible bug reports | Credibility |
| Translate documentation | Demonstrates committed user base |
| Run local meetups/events | Shows organized community |
| Write case studies of your usage | Makes you visible to product team's bosses |
| Contribute code fixes | Becomes dependency (they need you) |
| Maintain a module/plugin/integration | Significant dependency |
| Represent a funded organization | Financial leverage |
| Organize collective action | Political leverage |

### The "Bus Factor" Strategy

Product teams worry about bus factor (what if key people leave?). You can create positive bus factor:

- Become the person who maintains the [your language] translation
- Become the person who answers questions from [your region]
- Become the person who tests on [your platform/context]
- Become the community that hosts the [regional] conference

---

## Step 4: Communicate Strategically

**The quote from the original:** *"Every time there's a lack of communication, people fill in the gaps. They tend to fill them in with whatever fear, uncertainty, or doubt they have in their heads."*

**The inversion:** Product teams fill gaps with assumptions about what "users" want—usually based on users who look like them.

### Communication Strategy for Communities

**Audience mapping (inverted):**

| Audience | What They Need From You | What You Need From Them |
|----------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Maintainers | Clear problem statements, willingness to help | Responsiveness, roadmap visibility |
| Product Managers | Usage data, business case | Prioritization, resources |
| Foundation/Governance | Evidence of community need | Policy changes, representation |
| Other Communities | Solidarity, shared learnings | Coalition, amplification |

### Reframe Your Needs in Their Language

Product teams respond to:
- **Data:** "47% of our users in [region] cannot complete [workflow] because [specific issue]"
- **Business impact:** "Organizations in [sector] are choosing [competitor] because [gap]"
- **Risk:** "Without [feature], regulatory changes in [region] will make this unusable for [number] users"
- **Opportunity:** "If [feature] existed, [large organization] has committed to adopting"

### The Communication Calendar

Don't be the community that only shows up to complain. Be consistently visible:

| Frequency | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Weekly | Engage in discussions, answer questions from your context |
| Monthly | Report on community usage, events, needs |
| Quarterly | Publish impact report, case studies |
| Annually | Present at conference, contribute to roadmap process |

---

## Step 5: Measure Community Impact

**The question product teams ask:** "How do we report success to leadership?"  
**The question you ask:** "How do we prove we matter?"

### Metrics That Matter to Product Teams

Frame your community's value in terms they track:

| Their Metric | Your Evidence |
|--------------|---------------|
| User growth | New users from your region/language/context |
| Retention | Long-term committed users you represent |
| Contribution | Code, docs, translations, support you provide |
| Market reach | Sectors/regions they can't access without you |
| Risk reduction | Edge cases you catch, security you find |

### Metrics That Matter to Your Community

Don't lose sight of why you're doing this:

| Community Metric | What to Track |
|------------------|---------------|
| Needs met | Are our jobs-to-be-done getting easier? |
| Voice heard | Are our issues being addressed? |
| Representation | Are people like us in decision-making roles? |
| Sustainability | Is our community growing, stable, or shrinking? |
| Independence | Could we fork/adapt if needed? |

### The Impact Report

Create a regular report that speaks to both audiences:

> **[Community Name] Quarterly Impact Report**
>
> **What we contributed:** [translations, bugs found, docs, code, events]
> **What our community represents:** [users, organizations, regions]
> **What we need:** [specific, actionable items]
> **What we're worried about:** [risks, gaps, concerns]
> **What we're celebrating:** [wins, growth, successes]

---

## Step 6: Renew or Redirect

**The question product teams ask:** "Should we continue investing in this project?"  
**The question you ask:** "Is this product still serving our community?"

### The Renewal Assessment

Regularly ask:

1. **Goals check:** Are our original community goals still being met?
2. **Trajectory check:** Is the product moving toward or away from our needs?
3. **Leverage check:** Is our influence growing or shrinking?
4. **Alternatives check:** Are there better options now?
5. **Coalition check:** Are our allies still aligned?

### Decision Tree

```
Is the product meeting our needs?
├── YES → Continue current strategy, expand goals
└── NO → Is improvement possible?
    ├── YES → Is our leverage sufficient?
    │   ├── YES → Escalate, organize, push harder
    │   └── NO → Build more leverage, grow coalition
    └── NO → Consider alternatives
        ├── Fork the project
        ├── Switch to alternative
        ├── Build community alternative
        └── Accept limitations, reduce investment
```

### The Fork Conversation

Forking is the nuclear option, but it's real power. Before considering:

- Do you have maintainers?
- Do you have infrastructure?
- Do you have the community to sustain it?
- Is the issue fundamental or fixable?

Sometimes the *credible threat* of forking is the leverage itself.

## Prompt Templates for Each Stage

### Stage 1: Goals Definition
> "Our community in [location] needs [product] to [outcome]. The specific gap is [gap]. This affects [number/type] of people. Success looks like [concrete outcome]. We're not just asking for features—we're asking for [deeper need]."

### Stage 2: Landscape Mapping
> "I want to understand how [project] makes decisions. Who are the key maintainers? What companies employ them? How does the roadmap get set? Who else is asking for things similar to what we need? Where are the leverage points?"

### Stage 3: Building Leverage
> "We want to become an essential part of [project]'s ecosystem. What can our community contribute that would make us impossible to ignore? What would make the maintainers need us?"

### Stage 4: Strategic Communication
> "I need to communicate [community need] to [project maintainers] in a way that gets prioritized. How do I frame this in terms of their goals while staying true to our needs?"

### Stage 5: Impact Measurement
> "How do I demonstrate the value of our community to [project] decision-makers? What evidence would be compelling? How do I track whether our influence is working?"

### Stage 6: Renewal Decision
> "We've been trying to influence [project] for [time]. Here's what's working and what isn't. Should we continue, escalate, or redirect our energy?"

## Key Principles

1. **Specificity wins.** "We need better accessibility" loses. "Screen reader users in French-speaking Africa cannot complete the registration flow because X" wins.

2. **Coalition multiplies.** One community is a request. Ten communities are a constituency.

3. **Contribution is leverage.** The more you're needed, the more you're heard.

4. **Document everything.** Your struggles today are someone else's roadmap tomorrow.

5. **Think in cycles.** This isn't a one-time ask. It's an ongoing relationship of influence.

6. **Know your alternatives.** The power to leave is real power, even if you never use it.

7. **Celebrate wins.** When the product moves your way, make noise. Product teams need evidence that community investment pays off.

## The Deeper Shift

The original playbook helps product engineers think: *"How do we engage the community to help us succeed?"*

This playbook helps communities think: *"How do we shape products to help us succeed?"*

Both are legitimate. Both are strategic. Both require intentionality, resources, and long-term commitment.

The difference is who's driving.
